## This is a test email

It's content is *markdown*. Parsed with **parsedown**.

But it is also php so "Hello <?= $name ?>!"

The next steps are:
- create email templates for sending activation codes
- create an activation code when a user get created
- send email with activation codes
- create routes for activating users by activation token and activation code
